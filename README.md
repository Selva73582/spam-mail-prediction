Spam Mail Prediction with FastAPI
This project demonstrates a simple web application using FastAPI to predict whether an email is spam or ham (non-spam). It utilizes a machine learning model trained on email content data to make predictions.

Setup
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the FastAPI server:

bash
Copy code
uvicorn main:app --reload
The --reload flag enables auto-reloading when code changes are detected.

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8000 to access the application.

Enter email content into the form and click "Predict" to see the prediction result.

Project Structure
main.py: Contains the FastAPI application setup, endpoints, and logic for handling predictions.
templates/form.html: HTML template for the web form where users enter email content.
transformModel.pkl: Pre-trained transformer model (if applicable) for text preprocessing.
logistic.pkl: Pre-trained logistic regression model for spam classification.
requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies.
Dependencies
fastapi: Web framework for building APIs with Python.
uvicorn: ASGI server implementation used to run FastAPI applications.
joblib: Library for serialization and deserialization of Python objects (used for model loading).
scikit-learn: Machine learning library for Python.
Notes
Ensure that Python 3.7 or higher is installed.
Models (transformModel.pkl and logistic.pkl) should be trained and saved separately.
Customize the HTML template (form.html) and FastAPI logic (main.py) as per your application's requirements.
